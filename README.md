# Active-Product-Sales-Analysis

With the rapid growth of e-commerce platforms, understanding customer purchasing behavior has become essential for maximizing sales and enhancing user experience. However, companies often struggle to identify peak transaction periods due to the massive volume of data collected through their platforms. In order to improve marketing strategies, resource allocation, and operational efficiency, it is critical to determine when customers are most active.

This project aims to analyze transactional data using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to uncover patterns in customer activity throughout the day.

# Results

The results are indicative of how sales typically peak in late evening hours prominently, and this data can be incorporated into business decisions to promote a product during that time specifically.
